# GTK Test
<hr/><br/>

### Note : This isn't really a huge project I'm working on, just a GTK playground for me. <br/>

## Compiling and Running on Linux <br/>

(might also work on MSYS2 on Windows or something I dunno)<br/>

Run this command
```
gcc -o gtk_test main.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk4`
```
